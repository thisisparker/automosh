# Automosh.py

Honestly this whole thing is pretty hacky and weird. If you're interested, I've [written a bit about what I'm trying to do](https://parkerhiggins.net/2017/07/making-mosh-ups-automated-datamoshing-from-multiple-video-sources/), and then [a bit more after tweaking some source videos](https://parkerhiggins.net/2017/07/he-did-the-monster-mosh-automated-datamoshing-with-tweaked-gop-lengths/).

## Requirements

With Linux/WSL: apt-get insall ffmpeg
then: pip3 install ffprobe
